Side project built to learn Solidity where Musicians can create NFTs for their albums and sell them to their fans.

It's a way fot the fans to support directly their favorite artists and be part of their community.

## Artists 🦹‍♀️

It's a way for artists to generate more revenues from their music, engage their audience and be able to create special events and offers for their NFTs owners.
